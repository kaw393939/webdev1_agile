# Unit Overview

A software product needs to work perfctly and address a real need of the product customer,  or at best it isn't worth making at all, at worst it will get you sued and/or cost you a lot more money than you ever expected due to errors, ommisions, public embarssment of the company, security vulnerabilities, wasted development or a myriad of other issues.  It's important to considere that the vast majority of software projects/products started are never completed successfully from a techncial or financial point of view.   In my 30+ years of experience one of the main things I've learned is that when you're designing a software product your job is to to try to figure out the LEAST/Minimal amount of software product you can create to resolve the business need that the software product is intended to address.  Minimalism is hard, so how you figure out what to make is a complex challenge and in this unit I hope to impart upon you some valuable experience and knowledge that will help you understand a varity of technologies and concepts that oftent talked about individually, but not discuessed from a wholistic practical point of view.  In this unitt we will be making the "hello world" of a product using Next.JS, Playwright, and GitHub actions.

When creating a new product, its important to understand that your goal is to work towards what's called a "pull" process of product development.  In product development you can either "push" a feature/product on customer or potential customer, which is often necessary when creating a "new" product; however, this is extremly risky because every decision made without direct input /request by a customer creates a risk of wasting resources (money) spent on the development, not meeting the needs of the customer, nott gain new customers, or lose customers.  To minimize this risk a product manager/designer/owner must seek to address customer needs that have been discovered by direct feedback from the customer or careful product research.
